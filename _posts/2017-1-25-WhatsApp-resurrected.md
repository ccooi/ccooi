title: Life after installing WhatsApp
---

I used to one of those trying to avoid it in order to keep my privacy.
5 years ago, I installed it but removed it after some months.
Last month, I re-install it again due to the group chat of my schoolmates.

The fact is that your life changed somehow after installing the world's most popular mobile messenger.  
You get connected to more people, be it friends or foes.
Your virtual life circle suddenly expands.
